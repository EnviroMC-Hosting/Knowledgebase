title: How to log in to the EnviroMC Panel
---


### Which panel do I use?
We have a few seperate panels depending on the service you have purchased.
For customers who have purchased a game server, they will want to use our modified pterodactyl panel: https://panel.enviromc.com

For customers with a VPS: https://control.enviromc.host

For customers with Bare Metal and Colocation: https://panel.bonsaihosting.com

<br />

### How do I login?
Each panel uses a seperate yet of credentials from the billing portal for security purposes (unless you're using an OAauth login method such as google or Github which has a unified login - at the time of writing, this is still a WIP not available to most customers). You will typically recieve an email upon first purchase prompting you to create a Game Panel/VPS Control Portal within minutes of the first payment being recieved. We advise checking your spam folder as a few email providers may flag account setup emails as they contain tracking tokens; these are purely for authentication & security purposes and are destroyed immediatly after sign in.

If you're unable to locate this email, head to the relevant Game Panel/VPS control portal and click "forgot password". From there, you can enter your email to recieve password reset email. This will still work, even if you've never logged into your panel account before.

If you're still not recieving a panel access email, please contact us via discord or via a web ticket for further support.

#### Note for subusers:
A panel account is automatically created for you when you're added to somebody else's server. You do not require a billing account and should recieve an email within ~2 minutes prompting you to create a panel account. If this email can't be located, you can also perform a password reset.
