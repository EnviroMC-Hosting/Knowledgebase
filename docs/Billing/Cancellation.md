# How do I cancel my EnviroMC service?

With the exception of a few services like colocation and those with contracts (typically only applicable to bussinesses and companies), all services have zero payment obligations. This means, if you choose to cancel, all obligations to continue future payments are ceased immediatly. Cancellation requests are automatically processed without staff intervention; you will immediatly recieve an email confirmation of cancellation with related information.

If a cancellation request has not been submitted, an automatic payment attempt will be made on the due date (DD/MM/YYYY format). Recurring payments that were made where no cancellation request was made are not eligble to be refunded.
