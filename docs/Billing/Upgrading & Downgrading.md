# How do I upgrade/downgrade?


#### How does billing work and what does Pro-rata billing mean?
We allow highly flexible upgrading and downgrading for most services on a pro-rata basis. This means that you will either only pay for the difference in price between two plans adjusted by how far you are through the billing cycle when upgrading or you will be returned an equivielnet amount when downgrading.
This might look like the following scenarious:

Scenario 1: You are 15 days in to a monthly billing cycle and want to upgrade from a $5/mo to a $10/mo plan. In this instance, you would pay ~$2.50 as a one off upgrade fee and then your standard billing dates would continue as $10/mo.
 
Scenario 2: You are 15 days in to a monthly billing cycle and want to downgrade from a $20/mo to a $10/mo plan. In this instance, you would recieve ~$5 back in credit and your billing dates would remain the same whilst charging you $10/mo instead of $20/mo.

At the time of writing, some products, including colocation and bare metal, require a ticket to be upgraded. Some other products, like virtual machines (VPS) can only be upgraded and not downgraded as KVM virtualisation doesn't allow disk contraction.
Upgrades/downgrades between product lineups (eg, between multigame budget and multigame premium) require manual transfer to a new node which can take a few days; if you would like to migrate it quicker or at a given time, we advise making a ticket after upgrading/downgrading.
